# Brite

A programming platform designed to induce a step change in the experience of…

1. **The user.** Too often our programs are slower than our users’ expectations
   or fail on the fine details of user experience like accessibility.
2. **The business.** Software is harder to build than necessary which means
   businesses are limited in the software they can build to serve their
   customers and augment their products.
3. **The programmer.** Some parts of programming are fun, but then there’s the
   frequent fighting with developer tools and the constnat forward progress in
   the ecosystem which turn old projects into technical relics.

It is a _really_ bold claim to say that we can induce a step change in the
programming ecosystem. Especially when we don’t have anything to back it up. We
realize you are probably very skeptical. We would love to answer questions.

Already, the design of the language is practically settled and you can read more
in the
[working draft of the language specification](https://build-phknwiumji.now.sh/).
We will be working to communicate more soon as we have work to show.

Brite will initially only target web applications.
