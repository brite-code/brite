//! The Abstract Value Tree (AVT) represents Brite code after names have been resolved and type
//! correctness has been checked.
//!
//! The AVT is different from the AST in that the AST is only a basic representation of syntax.
//! Whereas the AVT is a high-level representation of the program graph.
