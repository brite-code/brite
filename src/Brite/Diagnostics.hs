-- A diagnostic is some message presented to the user about their program. Diagnostics contain a
-- range of characters which the diagnostic points to. Diagnostics are only valid in the scope of
-- some resource since while they contain a range they do not contain the document that range
-- applies to.

-- Our diagnostic format is based on the [Language Server Protocol][1].
